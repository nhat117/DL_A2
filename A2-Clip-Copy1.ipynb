    "# 1. Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has become a major method for building systems that can interpret both visual and linguistic information. As artificial intelligence continues to develop, the integration of multiple data types has become essential for real-world applications. One of the key research areas in this field is **visual entailment**, which requires a model to determine whether a textual statement is logically supported or contradicted by an image (Xie et al., 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is significant because it connects computer vision and natural language understanding, two domains that have traditionally been studied separately. In many practical situations, such as news verification, customer service automation, and medical reporting, systems must analyze both written and visual content to make accurate decisions. Therefore, visual entailment is an important step toward creating AI systems that can reason in a manner closer to human cognition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the current research environment highlights the importance of multimodal reasoning models. Recent developments, including vision–language transformers, have shown that combining visual and textual information leads to better understanding and decision-making. However, these models often require large-scale computing resources that may not be available in restricted environments. Consequently, this project focuses on designing a smaller, TensorFlow-based deep learning model that remains efficient and effective for visual entailment prediction.  \n",

    "# 2. Dataset Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is derived from the **Stanford Natural Language Inference – Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE)** corpus. This dataset is designed to evaluate how well a deep learning model can reason about the relationship between an image and a sentence. Each example in the dataset includes an image as the *premise*, a sentence as the *hypothesis*, and a label that identifies whether the hypothesis is *entailed* or *contradicted* by the image (Xie et al., 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains tens of thousands of samples collected from the Flickr30k image dataset, which provides a broad range of real-world scenes. The associated textual hypotheses are written by humans, which adds linguistic diversity and complexity. This combination of real photographs and natural sentences makes the dataset challenging and realistic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SNLI-VE dataset supports the development of models that go beyond simple object detection. It requires systems to learn semantic relationships, such as actions, emotions, and spatial arrangements, that connect the visual and textual domains. During exploratory analysis, a slight imbalance was observed between the entailment and contradiction classes, with entailment samples being slightly more frequent. Stratified sampling was used to maintain proportional representation across training, validation, and testing sets. Images were resized to 224 × 224 pixels, and pixel values were normalized between 0 and 1. Hypotheses were tokenized using a vocabulary limit of 10,000 words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is well suited for visual entailment research because it tests a model’s capacity to merge linguistic and visual features. In contrast to pure textual inference tasks, this dataset encourages multimodal learning and supports the design of architectures that can perform integrated reasoning across two modalities.  \n",

    "The montage review shows that both *entailment* and *contradiction* classes cover a wide variety of human activities and environments, such as people walking, playing, sitting, and interacting with objects. This confirms that the dataset provides balanced visual diversity across labels with no repeated or irrelevant images observed, supporting the dataset’s integrity (Xie et al., 2019). Manual inspection also revealed that contradictions are often subtle and rely on fine-grained differences in context rather than obvious oppositions. Therefore, the model must learn to associate textual meaning with visual evidence rather than depend on surface-level patterns (Kayser et al., 2021).\n",

    "\n",
    "This subsection explains and justifies each preprocessing step used to prepare labels and core columns for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0 — Schema sanity check.**  \n",
    "The code first asserts that the required fields exist: `Image_ID`, `Label`, `Hypothesis`, `Premise`, and `image_path`. This protects the pipeline from silent failures and makes errors explicit early. Verifying schema before any transform reduces cascading bugs and supports reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 — Label text normalization.**  \n",
    "Labels are stripped of stray whitespace to remove accidental variants (e.g., `\"entailment \"` vs. `\"entailment\"`). Small normalizations like this prevent artificial class proliferation and stabilize downstream class counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 — Programmatic class discovery.**  \n",
    "Unique label names are collected from the data rather than hard-coding them. This makes the pipeline robust to future updates (for example, when a *neutral* class is added), while keeping a deterministic order by sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 — Mapping dictionaries.**  \n",
    "`label2id` and `id2label` are created to link human-readable classes to integer IDs and back. Deep learning models expect numeric targets; maintaining both maps preserves interpretability during evaluation and error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 — Integer encoding.**  \n",
    "A typed integer column `label_id` is added using the map. Integer encoding enables efficient storage and supports losses/metrics that consume class indices (e.g., sparse categorical losses), which are memory-leaner than one-hot targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5 — Column pruning and ordering.**  \n",
    "A view `df_trained` keeps only the fields required for the model and arranges them in a stable order. Tight control of columns reduces I/O, avoids accidental leakage of unused fields, and makes dataloaders simpler to maintain.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before transformation, the function verifies that all required columns exist: `Image_ID`, `Label`, `Hypothesis`, `Premise`, `image_path`, and `label_id`. This prevents runtime errors and guarantees that every sample has the necessary fields for both text and image modalities. Schema validation at this stage follows standard data-quality practices (Rahm & Do, 2000).\n",

    "**Step 2 — Missing value removal.**  \n",
    "Rows containing missing values in key fields are removed, as incomplete entries could lead to alignment issues between text and images or invalid label mappings. Removing missing data helps maintain integrity and prevents silent data corruption during batching (Han, Pei, & Kamber, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 — Whitespace and type normalization.**  \n",
    "All columns are converted to string format and stripped of leading or trailing spaces. This avoids hidden inconsistencies that may arise when data originates from multiple sources. String normalization is critical for tokenization and for ensuring that identical text samples are treated uniformly (McKinney, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 — Duplicate removal.**  \n",
    "Exact duplicates, rows sharing the same `Image_ID`, `Hypothesis`, and `Premise` are deleted. Removing redundant samples prevents inflated evaluation scores and ensures that the model does not learn repetitive patterns (Rahm & Do, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5 — Label text normalization.**  \n",
    "All label entries are converted to lowercase for consistent encoding. This avoids mismatches such as “Entailment” vs. “entailment,” ensuring reliable mapping to numeric IDs used during model training (Chollet, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6 — Column ordering.**  \n",
    "Columns are reordered into a consistent schema to maintain stability across saving and loading operations. A fixed column order simplifies debugging, merging, and later integration into TensorFlow or PyTorch dataloaders.\n",

    "## 4.3 Grouped Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many images in our dataset are reused with multiple hypotheses (some even with conflicting labels), a naive random row-wise split risks **data leakage**: the model might see the same image in training and validation and thus memorize visual features rather than learning generalisable cross-modal reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `GroupShuffleSplit` ensures that all examples sharing the same `Image_ID` remain within the same subset (training, validation, or test). This aligns with best practices for preventing group-level leakage: as long as group metadata is available, samples from one group should not be split across subsets (Chaibub Neto et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting in this manner (70% training, 15% validation, 15% test) and verifying group counts per split, we uphold evaluation integrity and ensure that performance reflects true generalisation to unseen images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 70 / 15 / 15?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a **70 % / 15 % / 15 %** partition strikes a practical balance between learning capacity and evaluation reliability. Allocating 70 % of the data to training ensures sufficient variety and volume for the model to learn robust multimodal representations without underfitting. The remaining 30 % is split evenly between validation and test sets (15 % each), providing adequate data to assess model generalization during tuning and final evaluation. This configuration offers a stable estimate of performance metrics while preserving enough data for effective training. Ratios such as 70 / 15 / 15 (or 80 / 10 / 10) are widely adopted heuristics in applied machine learning to balance the trade-off between training effectiveness and evaluation stability (Lightly, n.d.; Milvus Blog, n.d.). Moreover, it mitigates the variance–bias trade-off that arises when validation or test sets are too small to produce reliable estimates or when training sets are too small to capture data diversity. Although not theoretically optimal for every case, the 70 / 15 / 15 split serves as a sensible, empirically grounded default for medium-sized datasets due to its balance of practicality and statistical soundness.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Sanity checks and schema enforcement.**  \n",
    "  The generator verifies that required columns exist and copies the DataFrame to avoid unintended modification. Early validation reduces silent runtime errors during tokenization and batching, following standard best practices for data-quality assurance (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Label normalization and ID mapping.**  \n",
    "  Labels are trimmed and standardized before being mapped to deterministic numeric IDs. This ensures consistent ordering across runs and supports stable loss computation (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Paired-text encoding with a separator.**  \n",
    "  The *Premise* and *Hypothesis* are concatenated with a separator token before tokenization. This design allows the text encoder to learn the logical relation between them within a shared semantic context. The approach mirrors sentence-pair encoding methods widely used in transformer-based models (Devlin et al., 2019) and aligns with multimodal alignment strategies described in CLIP research (Radford et al., 2021).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **CLIP token length (77).**  \n",
    "  Text sequences are padded or truncated to 77 tokens, matching CLIP’s maximum context window. Fixed-length batching ensures consistent tensor shapes and efficient GPU utilization (Shi et al., 2023).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image augmentation (train) vs. deterministic crops (val/test).**  \n",
    "  Random cropping, flipping, brightness shifts, and slight blurring are applied only during training to increase data variety and reduce overfitting. Validation and test images use centered crops for reproducibility. These methods are validated by Albumentations and image augmentation research (Buslaev et al., 2020; Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pixel scaling to [0,1].**  \n",
    "  Image pixel values are normalized to the [0,1] range, which improves numerical stability and accelerates convergence (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`tf.data` batching, prefetching, and optional repetition.**  \n",
    "  Batches are constructed with `tf.data`, and prefetching overlaps data loading with GPU computation to minimize latency. Optional repetition allows for infinite dataset streaming during multi-epoch training. This configuration improves pipeline efficiency and ensures smoother GPU utilization (TensorFlow, 2023).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Learn from This Setup**  \n",
    "This data pipeline maintains determinism during validation and introduces stochasticity during training, providing stable evaluation while enhancing robustness to natural variability in multimodal data. By integrating augmentation, tokenization, and batching into a unified framework, the pipeline achieves scalability and high input efficiency.  \n",

    "This project tracks **accuracy** and **F1-score** during training and validation. While accuracy is intuitive, even a modest class imbalance can allow a model to perform well overall while neglecting minority classes. The F1-score, which combines precision and recall, ensures that both false positives and false negatives are penalized. Thus, F1 is used as the **primary** early-stopping signal, with accuracy serving as a **secondary** health indicator.\n",

    "### Targets (test set)\n",

    "The class distribution in our dataset is not severely skewed, so accuracy can still offer a useful performance signal. Nonetheless, to guard against subtle bias toward majority labels, we emphasize F1 as our benchmark.\n",

    "Empirical studies in **visual entailment** report test accuracies in the low-to-mid 70 % range. The EVE model achieved approximately **71 % accuracy** on the SNLI-VE benchmark (Xie et al., 2019), while AlignVE improved this to **72.45 %** (Cao et al., 2022). More recent multimodal entailment models, such as the e-SNLI-VE variant, report accuracies as high as **83.3 %** under more advanced architectures (Verhoef et al., 2025). Because our dataset exhibits only mild imbalance, F1 is expected to track closely with accuracy, though slightly lower.\n",

    "## Why Use TF-CLIP  \n",
    "\n",
    "Early tests using **KerasHub** and **TensorFlow Hub** gave setup errors because many hub models use frozen graphs that do not allow custom fine-tuning or optimizer updates.  \n",
    "**TF-CLIP**, built from OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021), offers a flexible TensorFlow interface with editable layers and dynamic training.  \n",
    "It supports GPU acceleration, mixed precision, and easy metric tracking, making it more suitable for research fine-tuning and stable training.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale for Model Choice  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **CLIP Backbone:** Strong multimodal representation.  \n",
    "- **ViT-B/32:** Balanced between accuracy and speed.  \n",
    "- **QuickGELU Activation:** Matches the pretrained CLIP design.  \n",
    "- **Pooling Strategy:** CLS pooling for images, mean pooling for text.  \n",
    "- **TF-CLIP:** Gives full TensorFlow support and easier fine-tuning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup combines CLIP’s semantic power with TensorFlow’s flexibility, giving a stable and efficient model for visual-entailment reasoning.\n",

    "# 7 Training Strategy: Partial Unfreezing and Focal Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "This training stage applies a **one-stage fine-tuning strategy** that combines **partial layer unfreezing** and **class-weighted focal loss** to adapt the pretrained CLIP backbone to the visual entailment task. The goal is to let the model learn task-specific features while keeping its strong general multimodal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature Review  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning large pretrained models requires balancing **knowledge retention** and **task adaptation**. Research shows that fully unfreezing all layers may cause *catastrophic forgetting*, while freezing too many layers can limit learning flexibility (Yosinski et al., 2014; Kornblith et al., 2019).  \n",
    "**Partial unfreezing** offers a middle solution by updating only upper layers that capture high-level semantics. This allows the model to adjust effectively to entailment reasoning while maintaining stable lower-layer representations (Howard & Ruder, 2018).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the dataset in this study shows **only mild class imbalance**, using **Focal Loss** still provides benefits. It slightly down-weights easy examples and gives more focus to samples that are harder to classify (Lin et al., 2017). This helps stabilize learning and improve recognition of subtle class differences between entailment types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layer Unfreezing Control**  \n",
    "   A fixed proportion of higher transformer blocks (for example, 20%) are unfrozen for training. This design helps the model adapt to the new task while keeping core visual-text relationships stable (Kornblith et al., 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimization Setup**  \n",
    "   The **Adam optimizer** (Kingma & Ba, 2015) is used with a small and adjustable learning rate (1e−6–1e−3). This provides smooth and stable convergence during fine-tuning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Focal Loss**  \n",
    "   A **sparse categorical focal loss** is applied with adjustable parameters `gamma` and `alpha`. Even with light imbalance, it ensures the model focuses on more complex or less frequent examples (Lin et al., 2017).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metrics and Evaluation**  \n",
    "   Both **accuracy** and **F1-score** are tracked. Accuracy measures general correctness, while F1 gives a balanced measure of precision and recall, which is useful even under small class differences (Sokolova & Lapalme, 2009).  \n",

    "# 8 Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Optuna/TPE vs. Grid/Random/Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### TPE’s Advantages for Visual Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)** provides a probabilistic modeling approach to hyperparameter optimization, outperforming both grid and random search in sample efficiency (Bergstra et al., 2011). Unlike grid search, which exhaustively evaluates parameter combinations or random search samples without memory, TPE models the likelihood of high-performing regions in the hyperparameter space, dynamically refining the search toward promising configurations (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "For **visual entailment tasks**, where each model evaluation involves expensive multimodal computations, TPE’s **adaptive sampling strategy** allows for better use of limited compute resources. It balances *exploration* (discovering new regions) and *exploitation* (refining known good ones), enabling optimal performance discovery within a restricted number of trials (Yamauchi et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "While both are Bayesian in principle, TPE models the distribution of hyperparameters conditioned on observed performance rather than directly modeling the objective function, as in Gaussian Process–based methods. This results in **better scalability to high-dimensional spaces**, which is critical when tuning multimodal models involving parameters like learning rate, dropout, and unfreezing ratio (Snoek et al., 2012; Yamauchi et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why F1@Validation as the Optimization Target\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Class Imbalance in Visual Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-score is chosen as the optimization metric due to its balanced consideration of **precision and recall**, crucial for tasks with class imbalance (Sokolova & Lapalme, 2009). In visual entailment datasets, minority classes, especially *contradiction*, tend to be underrepresented, making overall accuracy an unreliable indicator of performance (Rogers et al., 2020).  \n",
    "\n",
    "By optimizing for F1 rather than accuracy, the search prioritizes models that perform well across all classes, improving generalization on semantically nuanced examples. Empirical studies confirm that F1-optimized models achieve more stable per-class performance in imbalanced multimodal datasets (Wang et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why These Specific Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate, Dropout, and Unfreezing Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Rate (1e−6 to 1e−3).**  \n",
    "   Transfer learning literature identifies learning rate as the most sensitive parameter. Too high a rate leads to catastrophic forgetting, while too low slows adaptation. The chosen logarithmic search range balances *stability* and *adaptation efficiency* (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Kornblith et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropout Rate (0.1–0.5).**  \n",
    "   Dropout prevents overfitting by encouraging distributed representations across neurons. Studies in multimodal transformers show that moderate dropout (10–50%) enhances robustness without reducing convergence speed (Srivastava et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Percent Unfreeze (0.1–0.5).**  \n",
    "   This controls how much of the pretrained backbone is fine-tuned. Lower values preserve pretrained semantics, while higher values allow for task-specific refinement. The selected range aligns with empirical findings in vision-language transfer learning, optimizing adaptation without destabilization (Yosinski et al., 2014; Howard & Ruder, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification for Hyperparameter Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "| Hyperparameter | Range | Rationale |\n",
    "|----------------|--------|------------|\n",
    "| Learning Rate  | 1e−6–1e−3 | Stable adaptation in transfer learning (Howard & Ruder, 2018) |\n",
    "| Dropout Rate   | 0.1–0.5 | Regularization and robustness (Srivastava et al., 2014) |\n",
    "| Percent Unfreeze | 0.1–0.5 | Controlled adaptation of pretrained features (Kornblith et al., 2019) |\n",
    "| Gamma (Focal Loss) | 1–3 | Balanced focus on hard examples (Lin et al., 2017) |\n",
    "| Epochs | 5 | Avoid overfitting in short optimization loops and balance between performance and train time(Yamauchi et al., 2023) |\n",
    "\n",
    "These ranges are empirically grounded and consistent with prior fine-tuning studies on transformer-based vision-language models (Radford et al., 2021; Song et al., 2022).\n",

    "# 9 Evaluation and Analysis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of Visual Entailment (VE) models requires a comprehensive strategy that extends beyond simple accuracy to ensure fairness, interpretability, and reproducibility. Visual entailment involves reasoning across both visual and textual information, where models often rely excessively on linguistic patterns or dataset biases rather than genuine cross-modal understanding. This phenomenon has been documented in multiple studies of vision-language models showing modality bias and shortcut learning through text cues instead of true multimodal reasoning (Tu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, an effective evaluation must combine statistical, probabilistic, and interpretive approaches to capture genuine reasoning ability. A multi-metric approach is essential because single measures like accuracy tend to conceal issues related to class imbalance and semantic ambiguity. Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and balanced accuracy together provide a more realistic assessment of model performance. Specifically, F1-score and balanced accuracy highlight fairness across classes, while ROC and Precision-Recall curves reveal class separability and threshold sensitivity (Davis & Goadrich, 2006; Deaton, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical piece of this evaluation framework is calibration, which measures how well a model’s confidence aligns with its true correctness. Modern multimodal transformers often exhibit overconfidence, predicting with high certainty even when wrong. Calibration curves and metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and actual accuracy, enabling researchers to adjust confidence scores for more trustworthy predictions (Guo et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, error and bias diagnosis play a pivotal role in understanding model behavior. Tools such as confusion matrices, per-class performance metrics, and analysis of high-confidence misclassifications help identify systematic biases, for instance, semantic confusion between related classes or over-reliance on textual cues. These diagnostic insights help guide targeted dataset enhancements and refinements in multimodal reasoning models (Selvaraju et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure fair and consistent comparisons across models, agreement metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are employed. These metrics measure agreement beyond chance and remain robust even over imbalanced class distributions, which are typical in VE datasets (Chicco & Jurman, 2020). Macro and weighted averaging methods further balance evaluation results by ensuring minority classes contribute meaningfully to overall scores (Deaton, 2023). \n",

    "# 10. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This study shows the potential of CLIP-based models for visual entailment but faces several data, model, and practical constraints. The dataset of about 39,000 samples is relatively small and focuses mainly on human-centered scenes, which limits generalization to other contexts such as natural, industrial, or abstract environments (Xie et al., 2019). Although data augmentation and balanced class distribution help, label noise and repeated image use can introduce bias and lead to overfitting (Gururangan et al., 2018; Kapoor & Narayanan, 2023).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model depends heavily on pretrained CLIP embeddings that were optimized for similarity rather than logical inference (Radford et al., 2021). The 77-token limit of the text encoder restricts complex language understanding (Shi et al., 2023), and mild overfitting still occurs despite regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014). GradCAM visualizations provide only partial interpretability and do not fully explain the model’s decisions. Finally, high computational cost and slower inference reduce the model’s suitability for real-time or low-resource applications (Song et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research should focus on improving data diversity, model design, and interpretability. Expanding datasets with synthetic or multilingual examples can enhance generalization and reduce bias (Bugliarello et al., 2022). Exploring longer-context models such as Long-CLIP and adding cross-attention layers may improve multimodal understanding (Shi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021). Ensemble techniques can also help improve robustness and reduce result variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional training methods like mixup, curriculum learning, and self-supervised pretraining could reduce overfitting and improve convergence. Interpretability should be deepened using attention analysis, counterfactual examples, and human-in-the-loop evaluation to ensure transparency and consistency with human reasoning. These strategies can make visual entailment models more accurate, explainable, and practical for broader applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully fine-tuned a CLIP-based model for visual entailment, achieving competitive results on the SNLI-VE dataset. The study showed that multimodal representations can effectively capture logical relationships between images and text through careful data handling and systematic tuning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, generalization is still limited by dataset size, architecture constraints, and computational demands. Expanding data coverage, improving model fusion, and applying stronger interpretability methods can help overcome these challenges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this work contributes to research in multimodal reasoning by showing that pretrained vision-language models can be adapted for entailment tasks. With continued development, such models have strong potential in real-world applications such as fact-checking, assistive technologies, and medical imaging, helping to bridge visual and linguistic understanding in artificial intelligence.\n",
